## Portfolio-By-React]

### About
This is a revamped version of the portfolio app that I had made previously in a challenge.  This challenge uses React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
